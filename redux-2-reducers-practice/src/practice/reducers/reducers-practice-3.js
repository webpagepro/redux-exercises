/* 
  Problem #2
  
  Export a reducer that will manages an array of groceries. It must expect the following action types:
    - ADD_CONTACT
    - FETCH_CONTACTS
    - REMOVE_CONTACT
*/

// Theoretically, these action type labels would be imported from an actions file, but we will define them here in this case.
let ADD_CONTACT = 'ADD_CONTACT'
let FETCH_CONTACTS = 'FETCH_CONTACTS'
let REMOVE_CONTACT = 'REMOVE_CONTACT'

// Write your code below this line!
